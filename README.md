### Commands

| Command         | Action                                      |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `npm install`   | Installs dependencies                       |
| `npm run dev`   | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000` |
| `npm run build` | Build your production site to `./dist/`     |

#### Deploy to production

Requires `lftp` (`brew install lftp`). For password-free deploys, add credentials to `~/.netrc`:

```
machine 93.43.27.14
login mcweb
password YOUR_PASSWORD
```

Then `chmod 600 ~/.netrc`.

Deploy with:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This builds the site and syncs `dist/` to the server via SFTP, uploading only changed files.
